# Notice

**This fork is maintained purely to fix build issues with conflicting versions of the UUID crate for `repositive/cmp-platform`. These issues are due to Diesel's use of UUID v0.7 and `postgres`' use of v0.8. When these version issues are resolved, `repositive/cmp-platform` should point to the normal crates, and this repository should be deleted.**

Diesel gets rid of the boilerplate for database interaction and eliminates
runtime errors without sacrificing performance. It takes full advantage of
Rust's type system to create a low overhead query builder that "feels like
Rust."
